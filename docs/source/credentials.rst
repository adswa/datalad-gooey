Credential management with DataLad Gooey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DataLad can store credentials and use them to authenticate against a variety of services or infrastructures.
Among them are, for example, the credentials required to push datasets to siblings on Gin, GitHub, or similar services.
``DataLad Gooey``'s credential manager makes setting, querying, and removing credentials much easier than performing the actions via the command line.

Access to this tooling is provided via the ``Utilities`` -> ``Manage credential`` menu in the tab bar.
